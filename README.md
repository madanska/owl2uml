# owl2uml

#### Summary
Transformation from OWL Ontology to UML class diagram.

#### Introduction
This is an implementation of a design tool for transformation from OWL Ontologies to UML class diagrams.
It is implemented in Java as a Maven project using Eclipse IDE. 
Further information about the functionality can be found in our paper.

The tool is implemented as part of a master thesis in <b>2007</b>. 
It can be out-dated and is not guaranteed to be bug-free. 
Most of the library dependencies are included in the pom.xml file, except for eodm.jar. 
EODM (Eclipse Ontology Definition Metamodel) project was closed in 2008 (https://wiki.eclipse.org/MDT-EODM). 
Therefore, you may want to use an alternative library for parsing OWL ontologies (e.g., <a href='https://jena.apache.org/documentation/ontology/'> Apache Jena</a>)
